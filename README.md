# JavaScript Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrect handling of division by zero.  The `foo` function is intended to return 0 if either input is 0, but it throws an error when dividing by zero. The solution provides the correction.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains the faulty code.  The error occurs when the second argument (b) is 0, while the function should return 0 in this case. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code, preventing division by zero and ensuring the function's intended behavior.
